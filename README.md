This repository demonstrates an example of uncommon error handling in Python, specifically focusing on type errors that can arise from unexpected input types during division.  The `bug.py` file showcases a function that attempts division and handles a ZeroDivisionError. However, it also highlights the less common TypeError that can occur when operands are of incompatible types (e.g., string and integer, or integer and list).  The `bugSolution.py` file offers improved error handling.
